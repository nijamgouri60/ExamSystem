## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Server** initializes, loads/creates data files, and listens for connections.
2. **Instructor** logs in via terminal, manages questions, rules, and exam sessions.
3. **Clients** (students) connect and authenticate using their roll number and password.
4. **Exam**: Server distributes randomized questions, enforces timeouts, and collects answers.
5. **Evaluation**: Auto-grading with negative marking and suspicious activity flagging.
6. **Dashboard**: Instructor can view live rankings, accuracy, and flagged students.
